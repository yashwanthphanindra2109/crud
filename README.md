![Application snapshot](./src/images/app-overview.jpg)

Application developed as an assignment to college, subject Development for Mobile Devices, at UFPR, in order to learn building **React Native** applications. The project seeks to apply knowledge in functional components, screens navigation, Context API and reducers; This application is fully offline (no external data fetching).

The intent was to create a simple notes application with CRUD operations (create, read, update & delete) to explore the React API in mobile devices environment. We should have a screen to display a list of existing notes, feature to delete notes and features to see/edit new or existing notes in another screen. The state should be managed by **React Context API** and changes dispatched to a reducer.

## :trophy: Lessons Learned

- Build a swipeable component;
- React Native Navigation (stack mode);
- React Context API (including `useContext` hook);
- `useReducer` hooks to dispatch actions;
- Babel plugin `jsx-control-statements`!!! AWESOME üòç

## :rocket: Technologies & Resources

**Frontend:**
- React Native
- Expo Framework

**Development:**
- Visual Studio Code

$ npm start     # run development server
```
